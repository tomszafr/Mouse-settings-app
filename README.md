# Mouse Settings App
A small, simple Electron desktop application for Windows that allows the user to change some of the advanced mouse settings. Uses a native C++ node module to handle the modifications.

Made using [electron-react-boilerplate](https://github.com/chentsulin/electron-react-boilerplate) as the base.
